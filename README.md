#To-Do-List

##A simple website to add To-Do List! Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

This project allows users to input their tasks and mark whether or not the task is completed or incomplete. To add tasks, users simply write their task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add their task to the list. Users are then able to mark the task as complete, incomplete, or delete the task as needed. The website uses localStorage to store users task list so that if they close or refresh their browser, their task list will be saved.
